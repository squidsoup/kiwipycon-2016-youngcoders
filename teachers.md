### Raspberry Pi Overview

The Raspberry Pi is a low-cost, credit card-sized single-board computer developed in the United Kingdom by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org) to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing countries.

The Raspberry Pi is equipped with many of the features you would expect from a desktop computer: wifi and ethernet networking, HDMI video output and USB ports for connecting peripherals.

Additionally the Raspberry Pi features a GPIO port, or general purpose input/output port, which provides a low level interface for interacting with the real world.
